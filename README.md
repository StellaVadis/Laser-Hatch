This is an implementation and essay of the Zigzag Problem by our team, from Problem A, 2020 APMCM: http://www.apmcm.org/detail/2401 \
The details of codes have been demonstrated in our team essay 'Paper_Zigzag.pdf'.
# Version
MATLAB==R2020a
# Dataset
We have provided two samples of graph to be painted in the folder: 'graph1.mat' and 'graph2.mat'. \
The sample is an n x 2 dimensional matrix/array, where the 1st column represents the abscissa and 2rd column represents ordinate.\
For example, you may expect the Matrix: 
$
\begin{bmatrix}
 0& 0 \\
 1& 0 \\
 1& 1 \\
 0& 1  \\
 0& 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$
to be a unit square
# Manual of Codes
There are two main functions: 'zigzag.m' and 'circle.m'
