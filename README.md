This is an implementation and essay of the Zigzag Problem by our team, from Problem A, 2020 APMCM: http://www.apmcm.org/detail/2401 \
The details of codes have been demonstrated in our team essay 'Paper_Zigzag.pdf'.
# Problem Description (Refer to website for details)
The hatching entities must be closed curvilinear polygons, and multiple mutually-nested contour objects may be filled by group-hatching. For the hatching process of figures, the existing boundary contours shall be offseted inward or outward firstly according to edge  distance, before getting subject to the zigzag parallel or contour parallel hatch. The hatch curves  shall be even and regular, and be kept basically parallel to each other. Neither having omissions of filling in an area, nor repeated filling of the area is allowed. The hatching by laser marking shall generate hatched contours online in a real-time way. To meet the requirement of high efficiency laser marking, the hatch curves should stay parallel to the figuresâ€™boundary lines, distribute evenly to the greatest extent, and be generated automatically and quickly.  Efficiency is an important indicator for the generation of hatched figures.
# Version
MATLAB==R2020a
# Dataset
We have provided two samples of graph to be painted in the folder: 'graph1.mat' and 'graph2.mat'. \
The sample is an n x 2 dimensional matrix/array, where the 1st column represents the abscissa and 2rd column represents ordinate.\
For example, you may expect the matrix: $[0,0;1,0;1,1;0,1;0,0]$ to be a unit square. \
If you have more than one curves in the same graph, we need to insert an Nan between two curves.\
For example, you may expect the matrix: $[-2,-2;2,-2;2,2;-2,2;-2,-2;NaN,NaN;-1,-1;1,-1;1,1;-1,1;-1,-1]$ to be two squares both centred at origin.
# Manual of Codes
There are two main functions: 'zigzag.m' and 'circle.m', you may run them directly to obtain the result as displayed in video.
